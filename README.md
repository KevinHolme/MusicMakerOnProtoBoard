# MusicMakerOnProtoBoard
The music maker board and the rmf69 radio dont like to play nice, So this is a work around. 

Put the music maker feather wing on a Feather M0 basic Proto board,  Load this software on thae proto.  

This uses EasyTransfer  for Arduino to get the radio codes to the proto board.  Easy transfer is available in serial or I2c. I use serial. 

Easy Transfer can be found here. https://github.com/madsci1016/Arduino-EasyTransfer
